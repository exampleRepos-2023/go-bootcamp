# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
Programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".

An object can
- contain data in the form of member fields
- perform actions in the form of methods

```
Person:
    Name
    Age
    Occupation

  - Operate on variables within these functions or call other functions.
  - Spaghetti code with function calls upon function calls
- Imperative Programming
- Declarative Programming
- ...
